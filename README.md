## Challenges

Everything was a little hard to setup because the modules this week were a little buggy, but once it was I couldn't figure out a way to save a local copy of the fetch requests (aka the graph on the page). I decided to use a localstorage method, but im not sure if that is the intended way or we could also cache it via service workers. All I do know is that it seems to work fairly well, and offline it looks indentical to the online counterpart!
